Introduction to Recursion
-------------------------
Recursion is a fundamental programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. In this section, we'll explore the basic principles of recursion and its role in solving complex problems.

How Recursion Works
-------------------
In this section, we'll delve deeper into how recursion works under the hood. We'll discuss the call stack, function frames, and how recursive functions handle multiple instances of themselves.

Base Case and Recursive Case
----------------------------
Understanding the base case and recursive case is crucial to successful recursion. In this section, we'll learn about the importance of the base case, which stops the recursion, and the recursive case, which defines how the function calls itself with smaller versions of the original problem.

Benefits and Limitations of Recursion
-------------------------------------
Recursion has several advantages, such as simplifying code and solving complex problems elegantly. However, it also comes with limitations, such as potential stack overflow issues. This section will explore the pros and cons of using recursion in different scenarios.

Recursive Algorithms
--------------------
Recursive algorithms play a significant role in various domains, such as searching, sorting, and tree-based operations. In this section, we'll explore some classic recursive algorithms and their implementations.

Examples
--------
The Examples section will provide practical examples of recursive functions. We'll cover classic examples like factorial, Fibonacci sequence, and binary search. Additionally, we'll demonstrate recursive solutions to more complex problems.

Tips for Writing Recursive Functions
------------------------------------
Writing efficient and bug-free recursive functions requires specific techniques. This section will share useful tips to help you write clean and optimized recursive code.

Common Mistakes and Pitfalls
----------------------------
Recursion can be tricky, and programmers often fall into common traps. In this section, we'll discuss some common mistakes and pitfalls to watch out for when working with recursion.
