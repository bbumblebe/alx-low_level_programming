## Introduction

Variadic functions in C allow you to create functions that accept a variable number of arguments. This repository includes programs that demonstrate the implementation and usage of variadic functions.

## Files

- `variadic_functions.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
- `0-sum_them_all.c`: Function that returns the sum of its parameters.
- `1-print_numbers.c`: Function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
- `2-print_strings.c`: Function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
- `3-print_all.c`: Function that prints anything, based on a format string.

## Compilation

To compile the programs, use a C compiler such as `gcc`. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o variadic_functions
```

## Usage

After compilation, you can run the programs from the command line. Follow the usage examples provided in the respective sections below.

## Examples

### Example 1: Summing Numbers

```c
#include "variadic_functions.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int sum;

    sum = sum_them_all(4, 10, 20, 30, 40);
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Printing Numbers

```c
#include "variadic_functions.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    print_numbers(", ", 4, 10, 20, 30, 40);
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

### Example 3: Printing Strings

```c
#include "variadic_functions.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    print_strings(", ", 3, "Hello", "World", "!");
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

### Example 4: Printing Anything

```c
#include "variadic_functions.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    print_all("ceis", H, 3.14, "Hello");
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```
